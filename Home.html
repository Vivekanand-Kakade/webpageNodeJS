                <h2>Welcome to Our webpage!!</h2>
                <h4>The webpage you would find the world's encyclopedia</h4>
            <p>Congratulations on your new role and welcome to Mattel! We are excited to have you join our team and get started with your onboarding journey. You will be using our Workday onboarding dashboard to learn more about the company, access helpful resources, review important information, and complete key tasks for your new role. You will need to complete your Workday onboarding tasks by the end of your first day.</p>
            <p>If you would like to begin your Mattel onboarding before your first day, here are instructions for logging into Workday and completing onboarding tasks:
                <ol>
                    <li>•	Click on the URL in the box below to begin your Workday Onboarding journey - your Username is your Mattel employee ID, which is also listed for you below.</li>
                    <li>•	Your temporary password will be sent in a separate email. You will be prompted to change your password after your initial login.</li>
                    <li>•	Once you are in Workday, click on View all Apps – select Onboarding – go to Getting Started – then Ready.</li>
                    <li>•	Complete all Inbox tasks assigned to you.</li>
                    <li>•	Make sure to submit each item for it to save in Workday.</li>
                    <li>•	Additional Inbox actions will trigger once the first set is complete. Make sure to complete and submit those as well.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <article>Note: On your start date, the method of signing in will be different. The above process for logging into Workday will no longer be applicable – you will be converted over to our Okta authentication and you will use your Mattel network credentials (which will be provided to you on your first day) to access Workday and other Mattel systems.
<p>If you have any issues accessing Workday, please reach out to our Helpdesk at 1-888-803-6093 and identify yourself as a new hire. The Helpdesk representative will ask a few basic questions to identify you and be able to route your issue to the correct group within Mattel.</p>

<p>We look forward to working with you to achieve our purpose of empowering the next generation to explore the wonder of childhood and reach their full potential!
